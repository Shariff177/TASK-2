            Manga are comics or graphic novels originating from Japan. 
            Most manga conform to a style developed in Japan in the late 19th century, 
            though the form has a longer history rooted in earlier Japanese art. In Japan,
            the term "manga" refers to both comics and cartooning. 
            However, outside Japan, the word typically refers to comics originally published in Japan.

            Manga is widely read in Japan by people of all ages and walks of life. The medium spans a broad range of genres, 
            including action, adventure, business and commerce, comedy, detective stories, drama, historical works, horror, mystery, 
            romance, science fiction and fantasy, erotica (hentai and ecchi), sports and games, and suspense, among others. 
            Many manga are also translated into other languages to reach a global audience.

            Since the 1950s, manga has grown into a significant part of the Japanese publishing industry. By 1995, 
            the manga market in Japan was valued at ¥586.4 billion, with annual sales of 1.9 billion manga books and magazines 
            (also known as manga anthologies), equivalent to 15 issues per person. In 2020, Japan's manga market value reached a 
            new record of ¥612.6 billion, driven by the rapid growth of digital manga sales alongside an increase in print sales. 
            By 2022, the market hit another record value of ¥675.9 billion. Manga has also gained substantial worldwide readership, 
            and beginning in the late 2010s, manga started massively outselling American comics.
